# Prelica (Advanced methodologies for hydro-acoustics design in the naval propeller)

PRELICA aims to reduce the hydro-acoustic emissions of the propeller through accurate predictions that are able to simulate the noise radiated at all frequencies, through the combination of potential methods, RANS( Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes) and LES(Large Eddy Simulation), the use of advanced numerical modelling techniques and scientific computing and optimization algorithms.
